So, probably like me, you upgraded your iPhone to the latest and greatest iPhone
5, only to realize that your gmail account that you setup as exchange is no
longer working. You get that dreadful error, “The connection to the server
failed.”

Well, as it turns out, Google is no longer supporting Google Sync. I was so
baffled by this problem because my google apps account (Google Apps, NOT
personal gmail) was working just fine, but none my other personal gmail accounts
were working. After searching for hours, I finally stumbled upon this lovely
little post by Google, “[Google Sync End of Life][2]“. If you go to that article
it well provide alternative ways to sync your email, contacts, and calendar.
