I just recently was needing to change my Google Drive from using one Google account to another. When I looked at the Google Drive menu and the "preferences" menu item wasÂ greyed out, leaving me without a way to change accounts. This led me down a path of searching out a solution. In combination with my own intuition and the web, I came up with the following solution that worked.

1. Open Terminal
