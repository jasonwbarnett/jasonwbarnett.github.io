# About Me

Hey there! I'm Jason Barnett, the outgoing tech enthusiast with a knack for
solving complex problems. My journey has taken some interesting twists and
turns, but it's all led to where I am today. It all started back in high school
at the ripe age of 16 when I joined forces with my dad as a local "computer
repair wizard." From there, I spread my wings and launched my own business,
zipping around the San Francisco Bay Area fixing just about anything I could get
my hands on.

But life had more adventures in store for me. I crossed paths with [Mindjet][1]
(formerly [Spigit][2], a cool software company all about helping organizations
crowdsource ideas. I became part of their Technical Operations Team, where I
dabbled in all things infrastructure automation.

Fast forward to September 2015, and [Bridgewater][2] came knocking on my digital
door. I joined their ranks in November of the same year, and boy, did I wear
many hats during my time there. It was a place that pushed me to grow in ways I
never expected, both professionally and personally. I'm forever grateful for the
experience and the fantastic friendships I formed.

And now, the latest chapter: I've landed at [Altana][4] as a Principal SRE. It's
the first time I've been genuinely proud of a company's mission. The work and
the people I'm surrounded by at Altana have got me pumped!

I'm super passionate about tackling tough technical challenges. I thrive on
problem-solving and relish sinking my teeth into fresh, mind-bending puzzles.
Call me a bit of a perfectionist – if I'm working on something, you better
believe I'm going to do it right the first time. No cutting corners for me!

But enough about yours truly. Let's dive into why this site exists. I built it
with a couple of goals in mind: to sharpen my writing skills and to share tech
knowledge that might make the world a better place. Whether it's diving deep
into complex tech solutions or breaking things down for the not-so-tech-savvy,
I'm here to help.

So, there you have it – a bit about me and the mission behind this digital
adventure. Thanks for stopping by!
